I am broadly interested in developing statistical machine learning methods for structure learning and prediction of complex, high-dimensional systems arising in biological and social sciences. I am currently working in two areas: (a) network modeling of high-dimensional time series; and (b) detecting high-order interactions in complex biological systems using randomized tree ensembles. I also work closely with scientists and economists on a wide range of problems including  prostate cancer progression, large scale metabolomics, and systemic risk monitoring in financial markets.

Before joining Cornell, I was a postdoctoral scholar (2014-2016) in the <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/">Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley </a> and the <a href="http://biosciences.lbl.gov/"> Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory </a>. I received my PhD (2014) from the <a href="http://lsa.umich.edu/stats/"> Department of Statistics, University of Michigan </a>, and my bachelors (2006) and masters (2008) in Statistics from <a href="http://www.isical.ac.in/"> Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata </a>. Before joining the PhD program, I worked for a year as a business analyst at <a href="https://www.wipro.com/"> Wipro Technologies </a>.
